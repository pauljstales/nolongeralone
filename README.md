# no longer alone

"no longer alone" is a Battleship-inspired game.  
Instead of the sea, the battle takes place in space.  
The player has limited time and energy/shots to defeat the enemy.

## Purpose

The purpose of this game is to demonstrate core competencies with plain HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript/ES6.
It was a deliberate choice to avoid frameworks, libraries, and most tools.  
This allowed me to show DOM manipulation and other things that React handles for you.
Even web components were avoided, even though they are valid as core JS (because I would have used React or Angular!)

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
1. Why didn't you use Phaser, React, framework, or library? *I wanted to demonstrate core HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript/ES6 skills.*
2. Why didn't you use Canvas? *Canvas is HTML5, but I wanted to demonstrate an understanding of DOM manipulation.*
3. Why didn't you use Web Components? *I would have used React or Angular if I was going to use components!*
4. Are you using BEM? *Somewhat, the blocks, elements belonging to blocks, the modifiers, the naming…*
5. Why not a library for the internationalization? *Similar to #1, I wanted to demonstrate the core technology free of libraries.*
6. Why are you using constants, but still have hard-coded strings? *I wanted to use constants to refer to the same things via constant in the JS, but without templates, libraries, etc. it would be quite difficult to have a single, central “source” of constants.*
7. Why Battleship? *It is a very boring game that could be so much better with some adjustments… and here are some of those adjustments. *
